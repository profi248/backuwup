# backuwup
This software is the implementation part of my bachelor's thesis, [PDF download](https://github.com/profi248/backuwup/releases/download/final/thesis.pdf).

This bachelor’s thesis explores creating a peer-to-peer backup application that allows users to create a backup to other randomly selected users — in exchange for some of their free disk space. The theoretical part of this thesis involves analyzing the requirements, creating the design, and proposing solutions to its deficiencies. The implementation part features a functional proof-of-concept application that showcases the concept.
